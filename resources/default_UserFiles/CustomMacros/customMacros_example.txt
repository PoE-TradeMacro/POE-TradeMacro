/*
	Custom macro example and main file.
	
	There are two reasons for this file to be included:
		- You can't execute any code outside of hotkey labels or by editing AdditionalMacros without it.
		- To give some examples on how to add your own macros.
	
	IMPORTANT NOTICE:
		Every hotkey assigned in AdditionalMacros will be assigned no matter if it's set to ON or OFF. It
		simply won't be triggered if it's off.
		If you want to use one of those hotkeys for your own macro you have to reassign it via the Hotkey
		command. Use the "CM_ExecuteCustomMacrosCode_Label" label for this.

CM_ExecuteCustomMacrosCode_Label:
	/*
		Don't remove/rename this Label (and this file in general).
		
		AHK has two ways to execute code, the "normal" way by simply writing it down in the script or via 
		function/label call. AdditionalMacros and all custom macros are included in ItemInfo/TradeMacro after
		at least one "return" was written in the script. This means that "normal" code execution is not 
		possible anymore. All code after this point has to be executed via label/function call.
		
		Labels can only be called in two ways. Via hotkey or from inside other labels/functions. 
		This means you either have to add your own hotkeys or add your code inside this label since it gets called
		by AdditionalMacros if you don't want to edit AdditionalMacros.
		
		
		Example of reassigning the "F4" hotkey that is assigned in AdditionalMacros:
			- First of you have to create a label such as this, for example "CM_MyHotkey" (look further down in this script).
			- Then you use the following code placed here inside this label:
			
			Hotkey, F4, CM_MyHotkey
